Locker Voltage regulators

Required properties:
- compatible: Must be "regulator-locker";
- Must have atleast 2 vinX-supply nodes
- Must have atleast 2 vout nodes
- Must have maximum-spread
- The counting for vout and vinX-supplies starts from 1 as shown below

Any property defined as part of the core regulator
binding, defined in regulator.txt, can also be used.

Example:

       int-voltage-locker {
               compatible = "regulator-locker";
               vin1-supply = <&buck2_reg>; /* real vdd_arm */
               vin2-supply = <&buck3_reg>; /* real vdd_int */
               maximum-spread = <300000>;
               locker-regulators {
                       vout1 {
                               regulator-name = "vdd_arm";
                               regulator-min-microvolt = <800000>;
                               regulator-max-microvolt = <1500000>;
                               regulator-always-on;
                               regulator-boot-on;
                       };
                       vout2 {
                               regulator-name = "vdd_int";
                               regulator-min-microvolt = <800000>;
                               regulator-max-microvolt = <1400000>;
                               regulator-always-on;
                               regulator-boot-on;
                       };
               };
       };
